# Building review packets from artifacts

Use `templates/review-packet.md` for every declared executable review stage. It is an assembly template, not a new reviewer stage or an implemented packet-building service. The coordinator fills it from existing run artifacts; it does not invent new objectives each time.

## Declare inputs before execution

Each stage in run.yaml adds `scope_tasks`, `criteria`, and `criteria_source` to its existing trigger/lens/role/budget. IDs refer to the tasklist and an implementation acceptance contract, not planning-completion criteria. The same packet template covers both lenses. Put behavior/expected outcomes and required proof next to each criterion once; do not create separate catalogs per reviewer.

## Assemble mechanically

| Packet field | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Role, reasoning, lens, budget, trigger and scope | run.yaml + durable consumed counters |
| Full North Star | northstar.md, copied verbatim with digest |
| Objective, authority, non-goals | current agent_goal.md |
| Expected behavior and dependencies | declared criteria_source, selected criterion IDs |
| Decisions and scoped tasks | plan.md and tasklist.md; final holistic includes the full plan |
| Candidate identity, source paths and diff | frozen checkout/snapshot plus changed-path census |
| Proof coverage | test/execution receipts with command, input/environment identity, result and evidence digest |
| Prior issue dispositions | recorded concrete findings and oracle decisions, not prior verdict narratives |
| Correction scope | actual delta and affected criteria/dependency closure, preserving other results |

Create one packet under briefs/ or checkins/ per actual stage/round. Attach a simple manifest of the exact input paths/digests; the packet and referenced files must remain available unchanged to the reviewer. Do not embed full workflow payloads/logs by default: link exact frozen artifacts. Do not substitute conversation history or the worker's completion summary for source and test evidence. Do not silently truncate requirements; link bulky evidence and provide readable criteria.

Before dispatch verify required sections, criterion coverage (including explicit MISSING rows), valid frozen identities and accessible referenced artifacts. If the stage trigger's required tests have not passed, perform the work/checks rather than use review to discover known incompleteness. This is a mechanical readiness check, not another independent review or gate document. If a review must assess a genuine evidence gap, label it explicitly rather than fabricate proof.

First intermediate review: complete scoped implementation diff plus affected integration evidence. First final review: full integrated diff from run base, whole plan/criteria and end-to-end evidence, including unchanged surfaces relevant to integration. Correction rounds: changed source plus affected coverage and accepted findings, with full contract still available. Do not ask for a fresh strategy every correction round.

The completion lens looks for missing/incorrect implementation and insufficient proof. The strategic lens adds whole-system coherence, simplicity, preserved behavior and North Star alignment. Packet content and lens come from the declared role and stage; the resolved model binding is execution metadata and never creates criteria, authority or a new review objective. A final review can cover both in one invocation. A strategic concern must map to an existing criterion or concrete defect to block; alternatives and future features do not silently expand acceptance.

A rendered packet consumes no model call. Dispatching its reviewer consumes one round under run.yaml, whether the result is usable or UNKNOWN; no new count is created by the packet or lens. Oracle interpretation stays in the separately capped decision-request channel. Templates guide agents today; adding an automated builder/validator executable is separate work, not a claim made by these instructions.
